I would like to thank my supervisor, doc. RNDr. Tomáš Bureš, Ph.D., for finding me an
interesting thesis topic on a relatively short notice, providing the source code of the
TCOOF-Trust prototype, and overall help with the work.

I would also like to thank my partners, Andy and Fronéma, for their support and
encouragement. Without them, I would probably never even start this work.

% Abstract (recommended length around 80-200 words; this is not a copy of your thesis assignment!)
\def\Abstract{%
Access control policies typically take the form of a set of static rules pertaining to
individual entities under control. This can be impractical in real-world scenarios:
authorization invariably depends on wider situational context which often tends to be
highly dynamic. This leads to increasingly complex rules, which have to change over time
to reflect the evolution of the controlled system.

Ensemble-based architectures allow dynamic formation of goal-oriented groups in systems
with large number of independent autonomous components. Because of the ad-hoc and
situation-aware nature of group formation, ensembles offer a novel way of approaching
access control.

The goal of this work is to design a Scala framework and internal DSL for describing
access control related situations via ensembles. In particular, the framework will
define ensemble semantics suitable for evaluating the ensembles and establishing access
control at runtime.
